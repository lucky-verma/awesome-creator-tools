## Adding a New Tool

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

### Requirements

- **Relevant**: The tool must be useful for content creators (YouTubers, streamers, podcasters, etc.)
- **Quality**: The tool should be actively maintained and have a good reputation
- **Description**: Add a concise description of what the tool does
- **Correct Section**: Place the tool in the appropriate category

### Format

Use the following format:

```markdown

```

- Keep descriptions short (under 100 characters ideally)
- End descriptions with a period
- No trailing whitespace
- Alphabetical order within sections (automated)

### Open Source Preference

We prefer open-source tools when available. For open-source projects:

```markdown
- [Tool Name](https://github.com/user/repo) - Brief description.
```

- Tools that are abandoned or unmaintained
- Tools with malware or security issues
- Duplicate entries
- Self-promotion without disclosure
- Tools behind excessive paywalls with no free tier
